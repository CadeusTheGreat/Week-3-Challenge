# Week 3 Challenge
## What was the challenge?
The challenge was to run a program provided through a Jenkins pipeline and then to push it live and save an image to Nexus.
## How I expected the challenge to go.
I was expecting the challenge to go fluently at the beggining with setting up Jenkins & Nexus and then to increase in difficulty when moving onto creating the pipeline / Jenkinsfile.
## What went well?
What went well is that I got Jenkins and Nexus setup and running in short time. This allowed me to spend more time working on the pipeline to get the image built and pushed for Nexus to hook onto and push live.
## What didn't go well?
The project did not go successfully as near the end during uploading to GitHub, a mistake was made that overwrote the files and reset my progress.
## Future Improvements
In the future, I would make regular backups that are not being manipulated live so that in the event of data loss from an error like during this challenge, I do not loose all progress I have made.
